# 2.1 Confusion Matrix Calculations ----


# 2.2 Confusion Matrix Summaries ----


# 3.0 PRELIMINARY EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATIONS

# 3.1 [Savings] Cold That Are Not Targeted



# 3.2 [Cost] Missed Sales That Are Not Targeted



# 3.3 [Cost] Hot Leads Targeted That Unsubscribe

    
    
# 3.4 [Savings] Sales Achieved



# 4.0 FINAL EXPECTED VALUE TO REPORT TO MANAGEMENT

# 4.1 Expected Monthly Sales (Realized)


# 4.2 Expected Monthly Value (Unrealized because of delayed nuture effect)


# 4.3 Expected Monthly Savings (Unrealized until nurture takes effect)


# 4.4 Expected Saved Customers (Unrealized until nuture takes effect)


# 4.5 EXPECTED VALUE SUMMARY OUTPUT





# CONCLUSIONS -----
# - Can save a lot of money with this strategy
# - But there is a tradeoff with the threshold selected
# - Need to somehow optimize for threshold
