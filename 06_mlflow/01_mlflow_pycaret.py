# 1.0 PYCARET'S MLFLOW INTEGRATION ----

# When we setup pycaret, we setup logging experiments with MLFlow

# Job & Experiment Logging: clf.setup()
    # n_jobs = -1,
    # session_id = 123,
    # log_experiment=True,
    # experiment_name = 'email_lead_scoring_1'


# 2.0 MLFLOW UI ----

# !mlflow ui
# http://localhost:5000/

# 1. GUI OVERVIEW: HOW TO FIND THE MODELS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
# 2. SORTING: AUC 
# 3. SEARCHING: tags.Source = 'finalize_model'
# 4. DRILLING INTO MODELS


# 3.0 MLFLOW TRACKING & EXPERIMENT INTERFACE ----


# 3.1 TRACKING URI (FOLDER WHERE YOUR EXPERIMENTS & RUNS ARE STORED) ----

mlflow.get_tracking_uri()

# 3.2 WORKING WITH EXPERIMENTS (GROUP OF RUNS) ----

# Listing Experiments

mlflow.list_experiments()

mlflow.get_experiment("1")

mlflow.get_experiment_by_name("email_lead_scoring_0")

# Programmatically Working With Experiments

mlflow_experiments = mlflow.list_experiments()

experiment_1 = mlflow_experiments[1]

experiment_1.experiment_id
experiment_1.artifact_location
experiment_1.name
experiment_1.tags
experiment_1.lifecycle_stage

# 3.3 SEARCHING WITH THE EXPERIMENT NAME ----

logs_df = mlflow.search_runs(
    experiment_ids =  experiment_1.experiment_id
    )

best_run_id = logs_df\
    .query("`tags.Source` in ['finalize_model']")\
    .sort_values('metrics.AUC', ascending = False)\
    ['run_id']\
    .values\
    [0]            

# pycaret interface to get experiments


clf.get_logs(experiment_name = 'email_lead_scoring_0')


# 4.0 WORKING WITH RUNS ----

# Finding Runs in Experiments

best_run_id

mlflow.list_run_infos("1")[0]

# Finding Runs from Run ID

best_run_details = mlflow.get_run('9e2a699a82f64223b7c1ca1b4aa52709')

# 5.0 MAKING PREDICTIONS ----

# Using the mlflow model 

import mlflow
logged_model = 'runs:/9e2a699a82f64223b7c1ca1b4aa52709/model'

# Load model as a PyFuncModel.
loaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(logged_model)

# Predict on a Pandas DataFrame.
import pandas as pd
loaded_model.predict(leads_tags_df)

# Issue - Mlflow does not give probability. We need probabilities for lead scoring.

# Solution 1 - Extract out the sklearn model and use the 
#   sklearn .predict_proba() method

loaded_model._model_impl

loaded_model._model_impl.predict_proba(leads_tags_df)[:,1]

# Solution 2 - Predict with Pycaret's prediction function in production

clf.predict_model(
    estimator = loaded_model._model_impl,
    data      = leads_tags_df,
    raw_score = True
)

clf.load_model(
    model_name =f'mlruns/1/{best_run_id}/artifacts/model/model'
)

# CONCLUSIONS ----
# 1. Pycaret simplifies the logging process for mlflow
# 2. Pycaret includes a lot of detail (saved metrics) by default
# 3. We haven't actually logged anything of our own 
# 4. Let's explore MLFlow deeper with H2O (We can actually use this process for Scikit Learn too!)
